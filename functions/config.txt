We are now about to configure SVXLink to the specifications provided. 
They will replace those held in the SVXLink default configuration. 
To change them in the future, you can do so in the Web Dashboard. 
The first change will be to the USB soundcard in use. 
Then further changes will be to the SVXLink configuration. 
At the end of the configuration, you can access the Web Dashboard. 
The fixed IP address will be provided shortly.

The built-in SvxReflector if you choose to connect is the North America-Wide Reflector.
You will need to ask for a password by writing to g4nab.ne63@gmail.com
If you require another reflector then contact your Reflector Manager.
In any case you may add any password and change it when you have the the password confirmed,
or change the information for another HOSTS reflector and HOST_PORT and AUTH_KEY later.
